# Electrical Age: Re-Wired

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Electrical-Age/ElectricalAge.svg?branch=ports/1.10)](https://travis-ci.org/Electrical-Age/ElectricalAge)

Electrical Age: Re-Wired is a 1.12.2 port of the mod Electrical Age, an attempt to bring it to more modern version of
Minecraft. But here's a brief description:<br>
Electrical Age is a Minecraft Mod offering the ability to perform large-scale in-game electrical simulations.

## Note on this port
Although we are already through the way with a lot of stuff, like the sim, it's largely unfinished. Expect bugs, missing
features and functionality.

## How to get started

**The newest Electrical Age is Minecraft 1.12.2 compatible only. Forge/CleanroomMC is needed.**
<br>
Note: you may need to use [CleanroomMC](https://cleanroommc.com/), and we highly recommend that you do, it includes many improvements to forge, and 
allows for newer Java versions, like Java 21, and uses LWJGL3.

1. Download the [last mod release](https://github.com/brambora69123/electrical-age-rewired/releases).
2. Launch Minecraft with your favorite launcher, or the official Minecraft launcher. PrismLauncher highly recommended.

### Building from source

This option is primarily for developers. If you take it, make sure to join our Discord first; see the chat button above.

To build Electrical Age, you need to already have Git and the Java development kit installed. You should also have IDEA, which is what we recommend for working on it. You don't have to be running Linux, but it helps; you can typically install git and the JDK with your package manager, if they don't come preinstalled. Windows users are on your own.

Once the prerequisites are in place, run these commands:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/brambora69123/electrical-age-rewired.git
cd ElectricalAge
git checkout <branch you want to work on>  # Optional. The main development branch is also the default.
gradle setupDecompWorkspace
gradle runClient  # Test
```

We appreciate any help from the community to improve the mod, but please follow the pull request and issue guidelines. You can find the basic guidelines whenever you open one. For more information, go [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## ABOUT

Here are some highlighted features:

A better simulation
> Electrical simulation with resistive and capacitive effects. Behavior similar to those of real life objects.

Multiple electrical machines and components
> Furnaces, Solar panels, Wind turbines, Batteries, Capacitors, ...

Break the cube
> Cables, sensors, actuators, alarms, etc. can be placed on each face (outer and inner) of a cube, which allows a significant reduction of the consumed space by electrical installations.

Night-lighting revisited
> Lamps, switches, captors, ...

Small and big electrical consumers
> From lamps and electrical furnaces to miners and transporters...

Incredible tools
> XRay scanner, flashlight, portable mining drill...

Interoperability
> Old redstone circuits can be exploited with electrical <-> redstone converters.

Game lifetime/complexity extended
> A consequent list of new raw materials and items...

## CURRENT STATE

Electrical Age: Re-Wired is still in **pre-alpha**.
